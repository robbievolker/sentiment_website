--is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Yeah, I   mean, it's different each day, so   I really like that. I don't think I   could ever work in an office.   Behind a desk. (MORE) 2.
(CONT'D) (beat) No offense.
Everyday.
(dodging the subject) I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
Yes ma'am.
I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy?
I think I did. 3.
Right.
I didn't realize you wanted to read it.
Yeah. I mean, that's just--
No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know?
She has good days. But mostly bad. It's been a big help having me there. She really needs me.
(nods) Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I was in the hospital, after my last episode-- she was having trouble getting over there to visit.
Yeah, I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications? Nothing seems to make a difference.
(lying) Some.
I just don't wanna feel so bad anymore.
I wasn't bothering her, I was--
It's day to day. I'm doing everything I can to get her back on her feet. (re: pharmacy bag) Picked up her medicine. Gonna make her some dinner. 10.
(calls out after her) Hey Sophie--
I'll tell my mom you said hello.
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. I'm gonna make you some dinner, okay?
TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.
He's a busy man.
Ma, eat. You need to eat.
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much television.
(playful) Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
Stop it. He's not even gonna run. Why would Thomas Wayne want to be mayor? He can do more good as a businessman.
He will. Now eat some dinner.
How you feeling today?
(teasing) Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a werewolf?
What? Why?
Who tips their mailman?
Okay. I can try his office. Tomorrow. 14.
Hello. I have a personal letter for Mr. Thomas Wayne.
It's kind of important. I need to make sure he gets it himself.
Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to work for the Wayne family-- for 12 years. She was their housekeeper.
Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe at least call back to him? Tell him that I'm here.
Okay. Well, can I have your name? So I know who I left it with. 16.
Wait. He's right there. (goes up to the glass, shouts) Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.
It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.
(nods) My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy.
It means like "feeling for other people."
Kind of. But different.
I, I don't have the money for this, Randall. 18.
What for?
Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to see me?
Not quite. Haven't even performed yet. Just been working my material. This business is all about fine- tuning.
No. I got jumped. I told you about that.
(voice tightens) I don't have his sign.
They wouldn't let me see him. (lying) But they promised me it would get to him.
Look up.
Why are these letters so important to you, Ma? What do you think he's gonna do?
Help us how? 22.
You worked for him over 30 years ago. What makes you think he would help you?
I don't want you worrying about money. Everyone's been telling me they think my stand-up is ready for the big clubs. It's just a matter of time before I get a break.
What do you mean?
What?!
I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE.
I know. The Americans are really giving it to the Japs.
(softly) I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.
Why didn't Randall tell me the gun was loaded? He's my friend. With my luck, I could have killed someone. (beat) I could have killed myself.
(still to himself) I should have killed myself.
(louder to himself) I should kill myself.
Hello. I'd like to open an account.
Oh, hi. That's weird. (pausing to see if he's gonna laugh; he's good) I didn't know you worked at a bank.
Very glamorous. Look at this place.
I'm a comedian. I do stand-up comedy.
Yeah. You know, I'm always making funny observations. Always on the look out for my next bit-- so it makes sense.
I said hi to my mom.
Last week. You said to say hi to my mom. I did. Made her day.
(covering; trying to act cool) Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you as well, Miss.
(shouts out, to no one in particular) YOU KNOW WHAT?! I FORGOT MY ID! I'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU.
(PRE-LAP) (singing) --if you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it clap your hands. 29.
If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet.
If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet. (stomp, stomp) If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it stomp your feet.
(into phone) Hoyt, let me explain.
(into phone) It was, it was a prop gun. It's part of my act now. 30.
(into phone) Randall told you that?
(into phone) Hoyt--
(into phone) Say what?
(into phone; low) --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
(into phone; louder) I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN, face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along with his wig.
(shakes his head, stifling the laughter) Please. Don't.
Nothing. I have a condition--
No. It's just my stuff. I don't have anything.
Hi. Do you like to laugh?
Remember how I told you that I'm a stand-up comedian? (again) Hi. How are you?
Hi. Do you like to laugh?
(continuing without taking a breath) Remember the other day when I told you about my stand-up comedy. Well, I'm doing a set next Thursday and I'm inviting a bunch of my friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come and check it out. 38.
Were you crying? Why are you crying?
I'm sorry. I, I didn't--
What happened?
What for?
(finally) Okay. Well, all the info is right there on the flyer.
You know they say laughter is the best medicine.
Well I didn't think you were going to read it.
I lied. Everything bothers me.
It's personal. It's my private thoughts. Plus it contains original comedy material that I don't feel comfortable handing over to you.
So where will we be meeting? 40.
Okay.
How am I gonna get my medication?
Why are they talking to him?
(trying to stop himself from laughing) -- good evening, hello. (deep breath; trying to stop laughing) Good to be here. (keeps cracking up) I, I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say,-- (bad imitation of his mom, still laughing) "You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living." (laughs) "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"
So, did you laugh? Really couldn't see much from up there.
All I heard was my heart pounding.
What friends?
(he forgot; recovers) Yeah, I decided not to invite them. As a performer sometimes you want to see how a "real" crowd reacts. People who don't already love me, or, or have a notion of who I am, you know?
Yeah,-- I don't know how something like that happens.
You think?
(calls out to her) Hey. You want to get some coffee?
I don't know.
Not all of them are awful. Take someone like Thomas Wayne for example. He's a hero.
Sophie, he's the only one who can save this city.
What happened?
With your job. At the bank?
We don't have to talk about it.
Every time.
(thinks it over again) Every time.
(interrupting) Did you do it? Did you go to bed with him? 48.
Right. Wait, what do you mean?
(catching his breath) I'm sorry. I have this thing--
I don't know. I read you can get it from a brain injury or, or a lesion in there. My mom said I was born this way. Born laughing. 49.
Kind of. That actually started when I was a kid. The other kids made fun of me, called me Happy-- but not in a good way. I got so sick of it, one day when I was about ten, I, I,--
I took a razor and cut this smile onto my face. (she's taken aback as he points to the scars) Sort of like "You want happy? Here, how's this for happy?"
I've been thinking about this night my whole life.
(quietly) "That's life."
What is this? How come you never told me?
How could you not tell me, Ma?
(raising his voice; excited) (MORE) 52.
(CONT'D) Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son! How could you keep that from me?
(shouts after her) I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited. How can any of this be real!? How can Thomas Wayne be my father?
(lowers his voice; trying to sound calm) Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will you please talk to me?
Please.
(eyes still closed, head leaning against the door) What would they say, Ma?
It was a prop gun. And I didn't pull it out, it fell out.
Why don't you ask Randall about it? It was his idea.
What?
...
I don't know anything about it. 56.
Randall, I didn't shoot anybody. That wasn't me. And I don't have time for this, I got somebody real important I gotta go see.
(turning back around) What?
What are you talking about?
Randall. Your nose.
LOOKING DOWN AT HIS NOTEBOOK, STARING AT A PHOTOGRAPH OF THOMAS WAYNE RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.
IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE, at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a golden light.
My name's Arthur. I'm here to see Mr. Wayne--
I, I was just trying to make him laugh.
No, please. My mother's name is Penny Fleck. She used to work here, years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne that I need to see him?
Did you know her?
You don't need to cover for them. I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset when she found out. 60.
No. No, just let me speak to Mr. Wayne.
(blurts out) Thomas Wayne is my father--
You did this to her?
They told me she had a stroke.
(laughter choking up in his throat) No I,-- I have a, a--
I don't know anything about that.
Not for having a gun. That was prop gun. Part of my act.
They said I wasn't funny.
Now, if you don't mind, I have to go back and look after my mother.
Clown thing?
What do you think?
Excuse me, I was wondering how I could check my mother out of here?
Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her home. 65.
She's not gonna wanna stay that long. She doesn't like hospitals. Or doctors.
I don't like hospitals either.
Okay. Thanks.
Symptoms?
Can you tell me what those symptoms are again?
'S STAND-UP PERFORMANCE. Joker on stage smiling behind the microphone, under the harsh spotlight.
(ON TV) (trying to stop himself from laughing) -- good evening, hello. (deep breath; trying to stop laughing) Good to be here. (keeps cracking up) I, I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say,-- (bad imitation of his mom, still laughing) "You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living." (laughs) "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!"
(ON TV) It's funny, when I was a little boy and told people I wanted to be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. (opens his arms like a big shot) Well no one is laughing now.
Excuse me?
No, sorry. Wasn't me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If I were you, I'd walk away from this table before I strangle all three of you with that fucking stethoscope hanging from your neck.
MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold- out black-tie audience--
What? Yeah. No I, I-- 72.
Dad. It's me.
My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son. (beat) I know you didn't know about me, and I don't want anything from you. Well... maybe a hug.
Yes. But they wouldn't let me in, wouldn't let me see you. So I came here. I have so many questions.
How do you know?
No. What? I wasn't adopted.
No. No, I don't believe that.
(tries shaking his head no; still laughing and choking) No, no I have a con--
Sophie?
Can I ask you a question? How does someone wind up in here? Have all these people committed crimes?
(nods; looks down) Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes I don't know what to do, y'know, I don't think I can take any more of this.
Last time I ended up taking it out on some,-- people. Bad shit. I thought it would bother me but, it really hasn't.
It's just so hard to try and be happy all the time, y'know, when everything's going to shit all around you.
(backtracking) Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was just talking to talk.
(saying it out loud for himself to hear) So she was a patient here.
What?
I can handle bad. I've been on a pretty bad run myself.
No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get through this, that's why I'm here.
I don't know. I mean I've never been with a woman "like that," but, this feels like a beginning to me.
You what? What? What kind of woman are you? Who does that?
(shouts) Why not?
No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you need to hear this. Your mother's a bad person. She's a whore, she's seeing two men at once. You can't trust her,-- She'll break your fucking heart.
How come nothing ever comes easy for me?
(into phone; skeptical) Who is this?
(into phone) Yes.
(into phone) Murray wants me to come on the show?
Ma, remember how you used to tell me that God gave me this laugh for a reason. That I had a purpose. To bring laughter and joy into this fucked up world,--
HA! It wasn't God, it was you or, or one of your boyfriends,-- how could you let that happen? What kind of woman are you? What kind of mother are you?
What's my real name?
C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted. What's my name? Who am I really?
(interrupting, snaps at her) (MORE) 86.
(CONT'D) Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't been happy for one minute of my entire fucking life.
But you know what's funny? You know what really makes me laugh?
I used to think my life was nothing but a tragedy, but now, now I realize it's all just a fucking comedy.
You wanna hear a joke, Murray?
(reading) Knock-knock.
(nods; frustrated) Yeah, I don't know if I should cross or uncross 'em. Both feel completely unnatural.
Thanks for having me on, Murray. I can't tell you how much this means to me, it's been a life long dream. I have a joke for you--
You're right. You're right, uncrossed is better.
(wiping his eyes; restrained anger) You shouldn't be here. It's not right.
It's always been just me and her.
You saw that?
Yeah, well I guess you didn't get the joke.
(interrupting) Which hospital?
I just buried my mother.
(looks down, reading the card) Right. Thanks for coming.
That was a joke.
Is that today?
My mom died.
(beat) It's not a good time. I'm in the middle of something here.
(catching his breath) I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you believe it?
It's okay, Gary. You can go.
(OS) Go on. Go. You're free.
FOR A LONG MOMENT, before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind for good.
STEPPING ONTO THE ELEVATOR, TURNING TO FACE US AS THE DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE, FINALLY REVEALING HIS LOOK--
(shakes Murray's hand; effusive) Murray, I can't believe this is real, that I'm really here. 100.
Are you kidding? Thank you for the opportunity. I've been watching you forever. My mother never missed a show.
No, I don't believe in any of that. I don't believe in anything. I just thought it would be good for my act.
No. I hadn't heard.
Thank you Murray.
Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When you bring me out, can you introduce me as "The Joker"?
Honestly, I don't even know what my real name is.
Besides, that's what you called me on the show, Murray. A joker. Remember? 102.
(just nods, still laughing) Yeah. Isn't it great?
(between laughs) That's right. I'm not political, Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to make people laugh.
(reading) Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.
(nods, reads it again) I want to get it right. Knock knock.
(looks up from his notebook) It's the police, ma'am. Your son has been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead.
That's right, Murray. But she's dead now.
Yeah. She is.
I don't know who my father is, Murray. Turns out I was adopted and sexually assaulted by my mother's boyfriend.
(just keeps going, on a roll) Sorry. It's been a rough few months, Murray. I mean, after my mother died, the police came to question me at her funeral. Who does that?
Very funny, Murray. No, they came because I killed those three Wall Street guys.
There is no punchline. It's not a joke.
(shrugs) I got nothing left to lose, Murray. Nothing can hurt me anymore. This is my fate, it was always my fate. My life is nothing but a comedy.
(ON TV) Yeah. But comedy is subjective, isn't that what they say? Besides, the way I see it, what happened was a good thing. All of you, Gotham, the system that knows so much, you decide, you decide what's right and wrong. What's real or what's made up. The same way you decide what's funny or not.
C'mon, Murray, do I look like the kind of clown who could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody's awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. 111.
No. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives.
Why is everyone so upset about these guys? Because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV?
Yeah. I do. Everything comes so easy for him.
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever think what it's like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves. (shaking his head, voice rising) They don't. They think we'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild. Well, this is for all of you out there.
You're awful, Murray.
Playing my video, inviting me on the show,-- You just wanted to make fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh at Frankenstein on a crowded beach, isn't it? You're just like the rest of them, Murray. Everything comes too easy for you.
How about another joke, Murray? What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash?
(pulls Randall's gun) I'll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserve,--
(ON TV) (looks straight into camera; screams Murray's signature sign off) GOOD NIGHT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,-- THAT'S LIFE!
'S TACKLED BY TWO SECURITY GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from the audience around him.
'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING, reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking windows, looting stores.
BANGS HIS HEAD HARD AGAINST THE STEEL MESH CAGE-- BAM.
-- just thinking of this joke.
No.
Because it's personal, it's between me and him.
(nods yes) ...
Good. Everything's good now.
(beat) Yeah.
How I remember it.
