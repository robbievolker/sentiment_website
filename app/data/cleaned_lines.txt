It's certainly tense. People are upset, they're struggling. Looking for work. The garbage strike seems like it's been going on forever. These are tough times. (then) How 'bout you. How's the job? Still enjoying it?
Have you been keeping up with your journal?
Great. Did you bring it with you?
(impatient; she doesn't have time for this) Arthur, last time I asked you to bring your journal with you. For these appointments. Do you have it?
Can I see it?
No. You didn't.
Oh yeah. Because of what your mother said,-- about your purpose. "To bring laughter and joy to the world," right?
(reading out loud) "I just hope my death makes more sense than my life."
Does my reading it upset you?
I understand. I just want to make sure you're keeping up with it.
What about your mom? How's she feeling?
Seems like she's been sick a lot since you got home.
All right. So, I'll see you again, two weeks from today?
Is there something else I can help you with, Arthur? My next appointment is waiting.
(looking over his record) Do you know which ones you'd like increased?
Have you been sleeping? 5.
Arthur, you're on seven different medications. Surely they must be doing something.
We spoke about this last time, Arthur. You're supposed to bring your journal with you.
You said it didn't bother you.
What about it bothered you?
Arthur, I have some bad news for you.
They've cut our funding. We're closing down our offices next week.
We won't be. The city's cut funding across the board. Social services is part of that.
They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur. You don't have a voice and they don't really care what happens to you or to us for that matter.
